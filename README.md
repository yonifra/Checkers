# Checkers
A Checkers game with some decent AI coded in WinForms in C#
This game was coded a long time ago (around 2007), when I had little to no knowledge of how code should be written, or knew anything about optimizing it, so take it as a general coding example, don't follow it.

### Disclaimer
Also, I had no idea about Git at the time, so I might have included lots of crap, and binaries, so some cleanup could be in order.
